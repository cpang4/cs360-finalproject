				<h2>Background</h2>
				<p>When you are asked to think of skyscrapers, your immediate thought may be of a famous building.  From the Empire State Building in NYC to the Space Needle in Seattle, they are all very grand.  But, can they tell us anything about the communities they are located in?</p><br>
				<p>With the amount of free land space shrinking in the United States, buildings have been building upwards rather than outwards. This is an increasing trend, if not problem, in metropolitan cities such as San Francisco and New York. Likely, skyscraper construction will continue in order to meet housing demands, which will play a role in reshaping the iconic skylines of major cities.</p><br>
				<p>Skyscrapers are generally filled with offices.  With an increase in the number of workers in the area, we also expect an increase in the number of residential buildings.  Residents, in turn, need something to do besides go to work. This can be anything from movie theatres to museums to casinos. These major centers also attract non-locals into the city who then require hotels to stay in. We would like to examine the evolution of skyscraper construction in the United States through an interactive data visualization.</p><br>

				<h2>Project Objectives</h2>
				<p><b><i>Note:</b></i> We are defining a skyscraper as any building with height &ge; 130m.
				<br>The skyscrapers used for these visualizations are only <b> completed</b> ones.
				<br>Because most skyscrapers are multipurpose, for simplicity, we used a <b> main </b> purpose (what most of the floors occupy).</p>
				<br>
				<p>-Which are the tallest buildings in the US? (and how tall are they, relative to other tall buildings in this dataset?)</p>
				<p>-Where are the tallest buildings in the US? Does a certain city/state have the most tall buildings?</p>
				<p>-What are the purposes of these skyscrapers (casinos, offices, hotels, residential, etc)?</p>
				<p>-Is there a constant positive trend for the amount of skyscrapers constructed, or has construction halted?</p>
				<p>-How do US skyscrapers compare to other skyscrapers in the world?</p><br>

				<p>We are using the <a href="https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/csv/skyscrapers/skyscrapers.html">CORGIS Skyscrapers dataset.</a>

<!-- Analysis of line chart -->
<div class="container">
			<section>
				<p>Until the 1970's, it seems that there was not a burst in skyscraper construction.
					<br> There was a minor slowdown in 1990's in skyscraper construction, but again a burst in the 2000's.
					<br>Until the 1990's, most of the skyscraper construction was due to office. However, office construction has slowed down since the 1990's and instead been replaced by residential construction.
					<br>Based on the growth we have seen in the 2000's, it is not unexpected that the growth of skyscrapers in the U.S. continues rapidly.</p><br>

<!-- Map analysis -->
<div class="container">
				<p>It seems that every major city has at least one skyscraper. New York has a lead on all other cities in terms of skyscraper count. The closest competitor is Chicago, but in 2016 Chicago still has ~120 fewer skyscrapers.
				<br>New York was ahead of the skyscraper construction game, with ~70 already in the 1940's. By then, most major cities only had 1-2 skyscrapers, or none at all. It was not until the 1990's that every major city had at least 1 skyscraper. Some states, by 2016, still do not have any skyscrapers. </p><br>

<div class="container">
			<section><p>Based on "All", we can see that U.S. skyscrapers are mainly used for <i>office</i>, then <i> residential</i>, and then <i>hotel</i>.
			<br>It is interesting to see the makeup of what skyscrapers are used as you compare city by city.
				<br>When you look at San Francisco, a tech hub, it makes sense that 75% of skyscrapers are used as offices. This majority is also found in Houston, where 87% are used as offices.
				<br>Whereas in Las Vegas, skyscrapers are primarily residential or hotels (located in the Las Vegas Strip). Las Vegas is the only city where hotels are over 10%! (However, it is important to note that in raw numbers, New York has more skyscraper hotels).
				<br>In Miami, a whopping 81% is used as residential.
				<br>In New York and Chicago, the percentages for residential and office are not equal, but are still the majority uses for skyscrapers.</p><br>

				<p>The tallest skyscrapers in the U.S. is the <i>One World Trade Center</i> in New York City.
				<br>Of the Top 10 Overall, the majority of skyscrapers are located in either New York City or Chicago.
				<br>When comparing city to city, it seems that <i>New York City</i> is home to the tallest skyscrapers and Chicago in second place. Other cities contain skyscrapers, but their top 10 are significantly shorter than those in New York or Chicago.
				<br>It seems that most of the top 10 overall and city-wise are used as office or residential buildings. The tallest usually also contain an observation deck.

				<p>When it comes to seeing how tall U.S. skyscrapers are compared to other countries, only the One World Trade Center (New York City) makes the Top Ten at Rank #6. In the Top 10, Dubai wins with the Burj Khalifa, but China has the most skyscrapers in the top 10.
				</p>
				<p>Expanding to the Top 20, we see the U.S. has more skyscrapers with the <i>Willis Tower</i> (Chicago) at Rank #14, <i>432 Park Avenue</i> (New York City) at Rank #17, and <i>Trump Int.
